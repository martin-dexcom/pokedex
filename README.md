## Description
The **Pokedex** app is a simple MVC Mobile application to explore the basics of application development and other Swift.

**With the Pokedex app, you'll be able to:**
- Search through _all_ 1st generation Pokemons.
- See some details about them (e.g., Stats, Name, Type, etc.)
- Store them to your Pokedex!
- See your pokemon even when no internet connections are available.

**We'll learn how to:**
- Build a Swift 5, UIKit-based iOS application.
- The basics of Classes and Structures.
- Networking on iOS (URLSession)
- Third-Party Libraries (w/Cocoapods)
- Localization in multiple languages.
- Delegation, Singletons, Observers...
- And more!

## Playground
Before getting into the project, please review [Swift.org's](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html) Language Guide to get a good introduction on the inner workings of the latest iteration of Swift.

However, we've also prepared a [Playground file](https://github.com/martin-dexcom/Awesome-Swift-Playgrounds) that runs on Xcode and could be helpful to practice these concepts on a more 'Developer centric' environment.

## First Steps
To set-up your development environment, please do the following steps:
### Download Xcode
1. On your Mac, navigate to the **App Store** application and run it.
2. On the Search Bar, look for **Xcode**.
3. Once you find it, press the **GET** button and download it. Xcode is almost 10GB, so it might take some time depending on your internet connection.
4. Once the download is finished, Open the **Xcode** app and a prompt will appear asking you to **install** the **Developer Tools**. Press **Install** to continue.

### Install Homebrew
1. Open the **Terminal** app on your Mac. 
2. Run the following command:
```
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
3. It'll ask you for confirmation to install, **allow it**.
4. **Wait** until the installation finishes before moving to the next step.

### Install CocoaPods
1. Open the **Terminal** app on your Mac.
2. Run the following command:
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
3. **Wait** for it to finish before moving to the next step.

## Running Pokedex
1. On the ```Pokedex``` folder, run the following command to install all Pods.
```
$ pod install
```
2. **Wait** until all Pods are installed before moving on the next step.
3. You will notice that a new file named **Pokedex.xcworkspace** will appear in your folder. This is the one containing the project's source code as well as the third-party libraries.
4. Double-click on it.

## License
This is an **Open Source** project based on the **BSD-3 New** license, which means you can Star it, Fork it, modify it, and even distribute it in the App Store.
